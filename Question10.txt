The main difference between main() function and user define functions are, main function is a builtin function which is the controlling section of our code. On the other hand, user define function isn't a builtin function and it's control only the code it's occupy. main function gives a platform for calling users define function. User define function is one that we define in our code but a builtin function is a function that already exists in the language. These are the key difference between main function and user define function.
